* ChatterPlot.R: Prototype of ChatterPlot functions. Not all were able to be implemented into final application. Written in R data analysis language. Couldn't be incorporated into final product due to the language difference and complexity of the functions in the given timeframe.

This demo did not end up working, there was a problem with openai and the modules with it not being compatible with the python version. The methods can show what the demo is intended to do.
